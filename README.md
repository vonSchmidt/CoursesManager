#Courses Manager
-----------------

A simple Java tool that:
    * Reads Course data from a Text File
    
    * Creates Course Objects
    
    * Links them with a List
    
    * Serializes them
    
    * Deserializes them
    
    * Format them in a new DB File
    
    * Creates an Index File for DB
    
    * Provides a By-Index Search Engine

*Notice*: More Optimization can be done, but just sticking
to the HWK's Requirements for now.
